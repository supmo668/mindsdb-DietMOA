"""
Neo4j Graph Database Client
===========================

High-performance client for interacting with the Neo4j dietary and nutritional knowledge graph,
providing connection pooling, query optimization, and transaction management.

Features:
--------
- Connection pooling with automatic retry
- Query result caching
- Batch operations support
- Transaction management
- Performance monitoring
- Query plan analysis

Connection Management:
--------------------
- Connection pool size: 10-50 connections
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Load balancing across cluster nodes
- SSL/TLS support
- Authentication management

Query Optimization:
------------------
- Prepared statement caching
- Query plan analysis
- Index hint generation
- Batch processing
- Parallel query execution

Core Methods:
------------
execute_query(cypher: str, parameters: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    Execute a Cypher query with parameters
    
execute_batch(queries: List[Query]) -> List[Result]:
    Execute multiple queries in a single transaction
    
find_shortest_path(start_node: str, end_node: str) -> Path:
    Find shortest path between two nodes
    
run_algorithm(algorithm: str, config: Dict) -> AlgorithmResult:
    Run graph algorithms (PageRank, community detection, etc.)
    
export_subgraph(query: str) -> GraphData:
    Export subgraph for visualization

Transaction Support:
-------------------
- ACID compliance
- Read/write transactions
- Transaction rollback
- Deadlock detection
- Optimistic locking

Performance Metrics:
-------------------
- Query execution time tracking
- Cache hit ratio monitoring
- Connection pool utilization
- Memory usage tracking
- Query plan cost analysis

Error Handling:
--------------
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Connection failure recovery
- Query timeout management
- Constraint violation handling
- Deadlock resolution

Security:
--------
- Parameterized queries only
- Input validation
- Query complexity limits
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

Usage Example:
-------------
    client = Neo4jClient(uri="bolt://localhost:7687")
    
    # Simple query
    results = client.execute_query(
        "MATCH (c:Compound {name: $name}) RETURN c",
        {"name": "aspirin"}
    )
    
    # Batch operations
    queries = [
        Query("CREATE (c:Compound {smiles: $smiles})", {"smiles": "..."}),
        Query("CREATE (p:Protein {uniprot: $id})", {"id": "P00519"})
    ]
    client.execute_batch(queries)
    
    # Graph algorithms
    pagerank = client.run_algorithm("pagerank", {
        "nodeQuery": "MATCH (p:Protein) RETURN id(p) as id",
        "relationshipQuery": "MATCH (p1:Protein)-[r]->(p2:Protein) RETURN id(p1) as source, id(p2) as target"
    })
