Memory Management Tool with Mem0
================================

Manages conversational context, learned patterns, and user preferences
for personalized and coherent multi-turn interactions about dietary and nutritional queries.

This tool provides:
- Short-term conversation memory
- Long-term knowledge retention
- User preference tracking
- Query pattern recognition
- Context-aware response generation
- Memory consolidation and pruning

Memory Types:
------------
1. Working Memory (Session-based):
   - Current conversation context
   - Recent queries and responses
   - Temporary hypotheses
   - Active compound/pathway focus

2. Episodic Memory (Interaction-based):
   - Previous analysis sessions
   - Successful query patterns
   - User feedback and corrections
   - Research trajectories

3. Semantic Memory (Knowledge-based):
   - Learned drug-target relationships
   - Validated pathway interactions
   - Domain-specific terminology
   - User expertise level

Core Functions:
--------------
store_context(conversation_id: str, context: ConversationContext) -> None:
    Store current conversation state and active research focus
    
retrieve_context(conversation_id: str) -> ConversationContext:
    Retrieve relevant context for continuing analysis
    
learn_pattern(query: str, response: str, success: bool) -> None:
    Learn from successful query-response patterns
    
get_user_preferences(user_id: str) -> UserPreferences:
    Retrieve user's analysis preferences and expertise level
    
consolidate_memory(conversation_id: str) -> KnowledgeGraph:
    Convert conversation into persistent knowledge graph

Memory Operations:
-----------------
- Encoding: Convert queries to vector embeddings
- Storage: Persist in Qdrant vector database
- Retrieval: Similarity search with context filtering
- Update: Reinforce successful patterns
- Pruning: Remove outdated or contradictory information

Context Management:
------------------
- Sliding window of last 10 interactions
- Importance scoring for memory retention
- Cross-reference with knowledge base
- Conflict resolution for contradictions

Learning Mechanisms:
-------------------
- Reinforcement from user feedback
- Pattern extraction from successful queries
- Relationship discovery from interactions
- Terminology adaptation to user level

Memory Schema:
-------------
{
    "conversation_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-03T10:00:00Z",
    "context": {
        "active_compounds": ["CID123", "CID456"],
        "pathways_discussed": ["hsa04151"],
        "hypotheses": ["inhibitor of COX-2"],
        "user_goal": "find selective inhibitors"
    },
    "embeddings": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
    "importance_score": 0.85,
    "references": ["conversation_xyz"]
}

Privacy & Security:
------------------
- User consent for memory storage
- Anonymization of sensitive data
- Encryption at rest
- Access control per user
- Right to deletion (GDPR compliant)

Performance Metrics:
-------------------
- Retrieval latency: < 100ms
- Embedding generation: < 200ms
- Memory capacity: 10,000 conversations
- Retention period: 90 days (configurable)

Integration Points:
------------------
- LightRAG for knowledge graph updates
- MindsDB for pattern learning
- Neo4j for relationship storage
- Redis for session caching

Example Usage:
-------------
    tool = MemoryTool(mem0_config)
    
    # Store conversation context
    tool.store_context(
        conversation_id="conv_123",
        context=ConversationContext(
            compounds=["aspirin"],
            pathways=["inflammation"],
            goal="find alternatives"
        )
    )
    
    # Retrieve relevant memories
    memories = tool.retrieve_context("conv_123")
    
    # Learn from successful interaction
    tool.learn_pattern(
        query="similar to aspirin",
        response="ibuprofen, naproxen",
        success=True
    )
