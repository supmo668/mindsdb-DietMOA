Cypher Query Tool for Graph Database
====================================

Executes Cypher queries against Neo4j to traverse nutritional networks,
analyze metabolic pathway interactions, and predict dietary compound mechanisms of action.

This tool provides:
- Dynamic Cypher query generation
- Pathway traversal algorithms
- Drug-target-pathway relationship analysis
- Graph pattern matching for MoA prediction
- Network analysis metrics
- Subgraph extraction

Core Query Functions:
--------------------
find_pathway_interactions(compound_id: str, max_depth: int) -> PathwayGraph:
    Traverse from compound to affected pathways through protein targets
    
predict_moa(compound_smiles: str) -> MechanismOfAction:
    Predict mechanism of action based on structural similarity and known targets
    
analyze_pathway_crosstalk(pathway_ids: List[str]) -> CrosstalkAnalysis:
    Identify shared proteins and regulatory relationships between pathways
    
find_drug_combinations(target_pathway: str) -> List[DrugCombination]:
    Suggest synergistic drug combinations targeting complementary nodes

Graph Patterns:
--------------
# Drug-Target-Pathway Pattern
MATCH (c:Compound)-[:BINDS_TO]->(p:Protein)-[:PARTICIPATES_IN]->(pw:Pathway)
WHERE c.smiles = $smiles
RETURN c, p, pw

# Pathway Cascade Pattern  
MATCH path = (pw1:Pathway)-[:REGULATES*1..3]->(pw2:Pathway)
WHERE pw1.name = $pathway_name
RETURN path

# Target Similarity Pattern
MATCH (c1:Compound)-[:BINDS_TO]->(p:Protein)<-[:BINDS_TO]-(c2:Compound)
WHERE c1.cid = $cid
RETURN c2, p, count(*) as shared_targets

Query Optimization:
------------------
- Index usage for compound SMILES and protein UniProt IDs
- Query plan caching for frequently used patterns
- Batch processing for multiple compounds
- Parallel execution for independent subqueries

Graph Algorithms:
----------------
- PageRank for identifying key pathway nodes
- Community detection for functional modules
- Shortest path for drug-target relationships
- Centrality measures for hub proteins

Visualization Support:
---------------------
- Cytoscape.js compatible JSON export
- GraphML format for external tools
- D3.js data structures
- Interactive pathway maps

Security:
---------
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection
- Query timeout limits (30 seconds default)
- Resource consumption monitoring
- Read-only access for analysis queries

Performance Metrics:
-------------------
- Average query time: < 500ms for 3-hop traversal
- Max nodes returned: 10,000 (configurable)
- Connection pooling: 10 concurrent connections
- Cache hit ratio target: > 80%

Example Queries:
---------------
    tool = CypherTool(neo4j_uri="bolt://localhost:7687")
    
    # Find pathways affected by a drug
    pathways = tool.find_pathway_interactions(
        compound_id="CHEMBL25",
        max_depth=3
    )
    
    # Predict mechanism of action
    moa = tool.predict_moa(
        compound_smiles="CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"
    )
    
    # Analyze pathway crosstalk
    crosstalk = tool.analyze_pathway_crosstalk(
        pathway_ids=["hsa04151", "hsa04152"]
    )
