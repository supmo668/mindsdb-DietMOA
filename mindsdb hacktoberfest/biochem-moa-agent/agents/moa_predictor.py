Mechanism of Action (MoA) Predictor Agent
=========================================

Advanced AI agent that predicts how dietary compounds and nutrients work at the molecular level by
integrating structural analysis, target prediction, and metabolic pathway modeling
to provide explainable nutritional mechanism of action hypotheses.

Core Prediction Pipeline:
------------------------
1. Structural Analysis:

   - Docking simulation integration
   - Chemogenomic approaches

3. Pathway Mapping:
   - Target-to-pathway assignment
   - Pathway enrichment analysis
   - Network propagation
   - Systems-level effects

4. MoA Hypothesis Generation:
   - Evidence integration

    # Identify targets
    targets = agent.identify_targets(
        smiles="CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O",
        confidence_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    # Compare with known drug
    comparison = agent.compare_mechanisms(
