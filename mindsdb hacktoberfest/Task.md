🎃 MindsDB Hacktoberfest 2025
Supercharging AI analytical Apps with Knowledge Bases ⚡
Your mission: Create AI apps powered by MindsDB's Knowledge Bases that query enterprise-like data in place—delivering accurate, explainable answers.

🛠️ Core Task
	• Pick a use case where there is unstructured data and can benefit from making it searchable via natural language: (For example analyzing CRM Unstructured data: Notes, Emails, Calls, Meetings, Tasks, Conversations → transcripts, attachments, Tickets → Descriptions, associated notes/emails)
	• Pick the datasources that you will need for these use cases
	• Write a blog post (Medium, Hashnode, dev.to, LinkedIn) explaining your use case.
	• Write a pull request with your use-case implementation in the use-cases folder (create a folder for your use case with a descriptive name)
Your use case implementation can be either a notebook or an app, that uses MindsDB + Knowledge bases
